### I'm a PhD candidate in Information Science at [Cornell University](http://infosci.cornell.edu/){:target="_blank"}, where I'm advised by [Matthew Wilkens](https://mattwilkens.com/){:target="_blank"}. My research lies at the intersection of <u>natural language processing</u>, <u>healthcare</u>, and <u>gender</u>.

Here are a few research directions I worked on:

1. **<u>Evaluation of clinical models</u>**: After studying the integration of medical alerts within nurses workflows at [NYC Health + Hospitals](https://www.nychealthandhospitals.org/), I have been increasingly interested in evaluating clinical QA models. Recently, I have tested whether sentence-level annotations can achieve high inter-annotator agreement and reduced costs when evaluating LLM-generated answers to clinical questions, compared to coarse-level annotations.

2. **<u>Large-scale analysis of patient needs in online health communities</u>**: I have [analyzed user needs and support strategies](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.02.27.24303445) in endometriosis online communities, as well [perceptions of ablation and excision surgery](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmig.2024.08.001).

3. **<u>Interaction between gender and literature</u>**: I have conducted a randomized experiment with 3,000 participants to measure the causal effect of character gender on reader's preferences. I have used stylometry to explore style and gender play in *Terze Rime* by Veronica Franco.

I strive to ground my work through the theoretical frameworks of ethics of care and studying up. I enjoy using a combination of quantitative - NLP, causal inference, statistical analysis - and qualitative methods - surveys, annotations, interviews.

## Research Timeline
At [the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (Ai2)](https://allenai.org/), I‚Äôm developing a system that assists users in refining their scientific questions and exploring related academic fields by recommending follow-up research questions under the guidance of [Jay DeYoung](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=f8aP6RMAAAAJ&hl=en).

[Lucy Lu Wang](https://www.llwang.net/), [Yue Guo](https://yueguo-50.github.io/), [Matthew Wilkens](https://mattwilkens.com/) and I have been testing whether sentence-level annotations can achieve high inter-annotator agreement and reduced costs when evaluating the correctness, relevance, and safety of LLM-generated answers to clinical questions, compared to coarse-level annotations.

<!-- Recently, I have evaluated the information quality, empathy and actionability of GPT4 responses to endometriosis patient questions. Specifically, I compared GPT4 performance at answering endometriosis questions vs general medical questions, as well as across prompting strategies. We find that prompting GPT-4 to answer medical questions in the role of a patient advocate increases the empathy and actionability but not the information quality of the replies. -->

Over the past year, I have designed a large-scale randomized survey experiment to measure the causal effect of character gender on reader preferences. [Ian Lundberg](https://www.ianlundberg.org/), [Matthew Wilkens](https://mattwilkens.com/), and I found that character gender has a minimal effect on readers' preferences. These findings contradict a long standing belief in the publishing industry that men and boys are only interested in reading about people of the same gender identity. We are currently working on the paper detailing this project.

In the summer of 2023, under the guidance of Doctor [Kristen Pepin](https://weillcornell.org/kristen-pepin-md-phd), I expanded my previous work on endometriosis online communities by analyzing user sentiment toward mentions of excision or ablation surgery, as well as support type and topics most associated with each surgery. We presented this work at the 2023 global congress of the [American Association of Gynecologic Laparoscopists (AAGL)](aagl.org) and the findings have been published in the [Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmig.2024.08.001).

As [PiTech Impact Fellow](https://www.pi.tech.cornell.edu/), I have worked with [NYC Health + Hospitals](https://www.nychealthandhospitals.org/) to better integrate medical alerts within nurses workflows. I evaluated whether the recent intervention had successfully decreased the number of overridden alerts, and interviewed nurses at NYC H+H facilities to draw design interventions that better support their work.

Before that, I‚Äôve investigated patient needs and support strategies in endometriosis communities using Natural Language Processing on Reddit with [Rosamond Thalken](https://rosamondthalken.com/). We find that patients need greater empathy within clinical settings, easier access to appointments, more information on care pathways, and further support for their loved ones. [Here is the pre-print!](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.02.27.24303445)

I have also collaborated with [Marilyn Migiel](https://romancestudies.cornell.edu/marilyn-migiel){:target="_blank"} and [Giulia Andreoni](https://romancestudies.cornell.edu/giulia-andreoni){:target="_blank"}, to identify the ‚ÄúUnknown Male Author‚Äù in Veronica Franco‚Äôs poetry collection *Terze rime* with machine learning. This work is currently under review.

Prior to joining Cornell, I've worked as a Research Assistant at the University of Bologna, Italy, with [Angelo Di Iorio](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/angelo.diiorio/en){:target="_blank"}, [Silvio Peroni](https://essepuntato.it/){:target="_blank"}, and [Francesco Poggi](http://personale.unimore.it/rubrica/dettaglio/fpoggi){:target="_blank"}. There, I examined the availability of open access bibliographic data for Italian publications across fields ([published in QSS](https://doi.org/10.1162/qss_a_00203){:target="_blank"}), and whether bibliometrics extracted from open access dataset can provide insights on the evaluation of academic researchers ([published in Scientometrics](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-022-04581-6){:target="_blank"}).

I received a Master's degree in Modern, Post-colonial and Comparative Literature at the University of Bologna, Italy, with a thesis on computational approaches to model urban space in science fiction literature. This work resulted in [a publication on _The Journal of Cultural Analytics_](https://doi.org/10.22148/001c.18120){:target="_blank"}.
