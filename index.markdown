## About me

### I'm a PhD student in Information Science at [Cornell University](http://infosci.cornell.edu/){:target="_blank"}, where I'm advised by [Matthew Wilkens](https://mattwilkens.com/){:target="_blank"}. I leverage  <u>natural language processing</u> to promote <u>patient-centered perspectives</u> in clinical care, and to measure the gender gap in <u>fiction readership</u>. 

<br/>

<!-- Currently, I am working on two projects. The most recent is dedicated to evaluating the suitability of GPT models for patient question answering. The second most recent aims to measure whether gender discrimination in fiction readership. -->

As [PiTech Impact Fellow](https://www.pi.tech.cornell.edu/), I have worked with [NYC Health + Hospitals](https://www.nychealthandhospitals.org/) to better integrate medical alerts within nurses workflows. First, I evaluated whether the current practices for the implementation and retirement of alerts had been successful at reducing nurses' alert fatigue. Secondly, I interviewed nurses at multiple NYC H+H facilities. Lastly, based on the results of my analysis I provided design recommendations.

Before that, I’ve investigated patient needs and support strategies in endometriosis communities using Natural Language Processing on Reddit with [Rosamond Thalken](https://rosamondthalken.com/). We find that members request emotional support beyond biomedical knowledge and that they are attentive to the subject matter of posts when commenting. These communities provide support to patient populations that are missed by traditional endometriosis care.

I have also collaborated with [Marilyn Migiel](https://romancestudies.cornell.edu/marilyn-migiel){:target="_blank"} and [Giulia Andreoni](https://romancestudies.cornell.edu/giulia-andreoni){:target="_blank"}, to identify the “Unknown Male Author” in Veronica Franco’s poetry collection *Terze rime* leveraging stylometry.

Prior to joining Cornell, I've worked as a Research Assistant at the University of Bologna, Italy, with [Angelo Di Iorio](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/angelo.diiorio/en){:target="_blank"}, [Silvio Peroni](https://essepuntato.it/){:target="_blank"}, and [Francesco Poggi](http://personale.unimore.it/rubrica/dettaglio/fpoggi){:target="_blank"}. There, I examined the availability of open access bibliographic data for Italian publications across fields ([published in QSS](https://doi.org/10.1162/qss_a_00203){:target="_blank"}), and whether bibliometrics extracted from open access dataset can provide insights on the evaluation of academic researchers ([published in Scientometrics](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-022-04581-6){:target="_blank"}).

I received a Master's degree in Modern, Post-colonial and Comparative Literature at the University of Bologna, Italy, with a thesis on computational approaches to model urban space in science fiction literature. This work resulted in [a publication on _The Journal of Cultural Analytics_](https://doi.org/10.22148/001c.18120){:target="_blank"}.
