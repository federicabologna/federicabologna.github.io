### I'm a PhD candidate in Information Science at [Cornell University](http://infosci.cornell.edu/){:target="_blank"}, where I'm advised by [Matthew Wilkens](https://mattwilkens.com/){:target="_blank"}.

### My research focuses on <u>rethinking natural language processing</u> to promote <u>equity and patient-centered</u> care in healthcare settings using a mix of quantitative and qualitative methods. I am specifically interested in supporting <u>patients with chronic conditions</u>.

<!-- Recently, I have evaluated the information quality, empathy and actionability of GPT4 responses to endometriosis patient questions. Specifically, I compared GPT4 performance at answering endometriosis questions vs general medical questions, as well as across prompting strategies. Based on these findings, I am currently formulating preliminary recommendations for patients on how to use minimal prompts to receive more accurate responses from GPT-based tools. -->

I am currently working with [Daye Kang](https://www.dayekang.info/) to trace symptoms and treatment strategies in PCOS online health communities. We will then use these findings to provide recommendations for the design of self-tracking apps for PCOS patients.

Over the past year, I have designed a large-scale randomized survey experiment to measure the causal effect of character gender on reader preferences. Ian Lundberg, Matthew Wilkens, and I found that character gender has a minimal effect on readers' preferences. These findings contradict a long standing belief in the publishing industry that men and boys are only interested in reading about people of the same gender identity. We are currently working on the paper detailing this project.

In the summer of 2023, under the guidance of Doctor [Kristen Pepin](https://weillcornell.org/kristen-pepin-md-phd), I expanded my previous work on endometriosis online communities by analyzing user sentiment toward mentions of excision or ablation surgery, as well as support type and topics most associated with each surgery. We presented this work at the 2023 global congress of the [American Association of Gynecologic Laparoscopists (AAGL)](aagl.org) and the findings have been published in the [Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmig.2024.08.001).

As [PiTech Impact Fellow](https://www.pi.tech.cornell.edu/), I have worked with [NYC Health + Hospitals](https://www.nychealthandhospitals.org/) to better integrate medical alerts within nurses workflows. I evaluated whether the recent intervention had successfully decreased the number of overridden alerts, and interviewed nurses at NYC H+H facilities to draw design interventions that better support their work.

Before that, I’ve investigated patient needs and support strategies in endometriosis communities using Natural Language Processing on Reddit with [Rosamond Thalken](https://rosamondthalken.com/). We find that patients need greater empathy within clinical settings, easier access to appointments, more information on care pathways, and further support for their loved ones. [Here is the pre-print!](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.02.27.24303445)

I have also collaborated with [Marilyn Migiel](https://romancestudies.cornell.edu/marilyn-migiel){:target="_blank"} and [Giulia Andreoni](https://romancestudies.cornell.edu/giulia-andreoni){:target="_blank"}, to identify the “Unknown Male Author” in Veronica Franco’s poetry collection *Terze rime* with machine learning. This work is currently under review.

Prior to joining Cornell, I've worked as a Research Assistant at the University of Bologna, Italy, with [Angelo Di Iorio](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/angelo.diiorio/en){:target="_blank"}, [Silvio Peroni](https://essepuntato.it/){:target="_blank"}, and [Francesco Poggi](http://personale.unimore.it/rubrica/dettaglio/fpoggi){:target="_blank"}. There, I examined the availability of open access bibliographic data for Italian publications across fields ([published in QSS](https://doi.org/10.1162/qss_a_00203){:target="_blank"}), and whether bibliometrics extracted from open access dataset can provide insights on the evaluation of academic researchers ([published in Scientometrics](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-022-04581-6){:target="_blank"}).

I received a Master's degree in Modern, Post-colonial and Comparative Literature at the University of Bologna, Italy, with a thesis on computational approaches to model urban space in science fiction literature. This work resulted in [a publication on _The Journal of Cultural Analytics_](https://doi.org/10.22148/001c.18120){:target="_blank"}.
