## About me

### I'm a PhD candidate in Information Science at [Cornell University](http://infosci.cornell.edu/){:target="_blank"}, where I'm advised by [Matthew Wilkens](https://mattwilkens.com/){:target="_blank"}. I leverage  <u>natural language processing</u> (NLP) and <u>qualitative</u> methods to support <u>patient-centered care</u>, and measure the gender gap in <u>fiction readership</u>. 

<br/>

Recently, I have evaluated the information quality, empathy and actionability of GPT4 responses to endometriosis patient questions. Specifically, I compared GPT4 performance at answering endometriosis questions vs general medical questions, as well as across prompting strategies. Based on these findings, I am currently formulating preliminary recommendations for patients on how to use minimal prompts to receive more accurate responses from GPT-based tools.

 Last summer, I expanded my previous work on endometriosis online communities by analyzing users' perceptions of excision and ablation surgery under the added guidance of Doctor [Kristen Pepin](https://weillcornell.org/kristen-pepin-md-phd). Specifically, we analyzed user sentiment toward mentions of excision or ablation surgery, as well as support type and topics most associated with each surgery. Kristen and I then presented this work at the 2023 global congress of the [American Association of Gynecologic Laparoscopists (AAGL)](aagl.org).

As [PiTech Impact Fellow](https://www.pi.tech.cornell.edu/), I have worked with [NYC Health + Hospitals](https://www.nychealthandhospitals.org/) to better integrate medical alerts within nurses workflows. I evaluated whether the current alert management practices had successfully reduced nurses' alert fatigue, and interviewed nurses at NYC H+H facilities to draw design interventions that better support their work. [Here is an extended report](https://www.pi.tech.cornell.edu/spotlight/federica) on the outcomes of this project.

Before that, I’ve investigated patient needs and support strategies in endometriosis communities using Natural Language Processing on Reddit with [Rosamond Thalken](https://rosamondthalken.com/). We find that patients need greater empathy within clinical settings, easier access to appointments, more information on care pathways, and further support for their loved ones. [Here is the pre-print!](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.02.27.24303445)

I have also collaborated with [Marilyn Migiel](https://romancestudies.cornell.edu/marilyn-migiel){:target="_blank"} and [Giulia Andreoni](https://romancestudies.cornell.edu/giulia-andreoni){:target="_blank"}, to identify the “Unknown Male Author” in Veronica Franco’s poetry collection *Terze rime* with machine learning.

Prior to joining Cornell, I've worked as a Research Assistant at the University of Bologna, Italy, with [Angelo Di Iorio](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/angelo.diiorio/en){:target="_blank"}, [Silvio Peroni](https://essepuntato.it/){:target="_blank"}, and [Francesco Poggi](http://personale.unimore.it/rubrica/dettaglio/fpoggi){:target="_blank"}. There, I examined the availability of open access bibliographic data for Italian publications across fields ([published in QSS](https://doi.org/10.1162/qss_a_00203){:target="_blank"}), and whether bibliometrics extracted from open access dataset can provide insights on the evaluation of academic researchers ([published in Scientometrics](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-022-04581-6){:target="_blank"}).

I received a Master's degree in Modern, Post-colonial and Comparative Literature at the University of Bologna, Italy, with a thesis on computational approaches to model urban space in science fiction literature. This work resulted in [a publication on _The Journal of Cultural Analytics_](https://doi.org/10.22148/001c.18120){:target="_blank"}.
