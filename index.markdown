## About me

I'm a second-year PhD student in Information Science at [Cornell University](http://infosci.cornell.edu/){:target="_blank"}, where I'm advised by [Matthew Wilkens](https://mattwilkens.com/){:target="_blank"}. My research stands at the intersection of Natural Language Processing, Computational Social Science and Cultural Analytics.

I study social and cultural issues of contemporary relevance combining computational techniques with qualitative methods. Recently, I've investigated patient needs and support patterns in endometriosis communities on Reddit with [Rosamond Thalken](https://rosamondthalken.com/){:target="_blank"}. In addition, I'm collaborating with [Marilyn Migiel](https://romancestudies.cornell.edu/marilyn-migiel){:target="_blank"} and [Giulia Andreoni](https://romancestudies.cornell.edu/giulia-andreoni){:target="_blank"}, to identify the “Unknown Male Author” in Veronica Franco’s poetry collection _Terze rime_ leveraging stylometry techniques .

Prior to joining Cornell, I've worked as a Research Assistant at the University of Bologna, Italy, with [Angelo Di Iorio](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/angelo.diiorio/en){:target="_blank"}, [Silvio Peroni](https://essepuntato.it/){:target="_blank"}, and [Francesco Poggi](http://personale.unimore.it/rubrica/dettaglio/fpoggi){:target="_blank"}. There, I examined availability of open access bibliographic data for Italian publications across fields ([arXiv pre-print, soon to appear in QSS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.02111){:target="_blank"}), and whether bibliometrics extracted from open access dataset can provide insights on the evaluation of academic researchers ([arXiv pre-print](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07942){:target="_blank"}).

I received a Master's degree in Modern, Post-colonial and Comparative Literature at the University of Bologna, Italy, with a thesis on computational approaches to model urban space in science fiction literature. This work resulted in [a publication on _The Journal of Cultural Analytics_](https://doi.org/10.22148/001c.18120){:target="_blank"}.
