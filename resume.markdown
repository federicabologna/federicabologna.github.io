## RESEARCH & PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

**Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence** — *PhD Research Intern, Semantic Scholar*  
*Seattle, WA | June 2025 – Present*  
- Developed a query reformulation system that increased Asta’s recall of scientific information from **40% to 60%** on AstaBench.  
- Created the **Query Reformulation Benchmark** to evaluate reformulation methods using few-shot learning on thousands of underspecified and refined user query pairs.  
- Designing a user study to test the usefulness and relevance of the system’s suggested query reformulations.

**Cornell University** — *LLM & AI Research Scientist*  
*Ithaca, NY | Aug 2021 – Present*  
- Identified unmet user needs in **15,000+ posts** and **300,000+ comments** from endometriosis online communities using fine-tuned DistilBERT models and few-shot learning.  
- Demonstrated that readers have no strong preference for character gender using causal inference in a randomized survey experiment with **3,000 participants**.  
- Revealed that annotating a few sentences of LLM-generated clinical answers achieves comparable results to full annotations by designing a randomized survey and evaluation framework under limited resources.

<br>

**Cornell University** — *Teaching Assistant, Data Science and Machine Learning*  
*Ithaca, NY | Jan 2024 – Dec 2024*  
- Taught weekly sections on data science, ML, and NLP.  
- Delivered lectures on social media analysis and causal inference methods.  
- Designed class activities on preprocessing large census datasets and applying ML to predict social outcomes.

<br>

**NYC Health + Hospitals** — *Data Scientist Intern*  
*New York City, NY | Jun 2023 – Aug 2023*  
*Funded by the Siegel Family Endowment PiTech PhD Impact Fellowship*  
- Analyzed **~3,000,000 clinical interruptive alerts**, identifying three alerts frequently overridden by nurses.  
- Showed that revising alert criteria can reduce unnecessary alerts by up to **94%**, while improving alert design can decrease overridden alerts by **64%**.  
- Findings led to organization-wide revisions of alert criteria after presentations to hospital administration and informatics experts.
