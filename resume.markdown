#### RESEARCH & PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

**Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence** — *PhD Research Intern, Semantic Scholar*  
*Seattle, WA | June 2025 – Present*  
- Developed a query reformulation system that increases Asta’s recall of scientific information in the output by 50%.
- Created the Query Reformulation Benchmark to evaluate query reformulation methods by augmenting thousands of pairs of underspecified and refined user queries with few-shot learning.
- Designing a user study to test the usefulness and relevance of our system’s suggested query reformulations.

**Cornell University** — *LLM & AI Research Scientist*  
*Ithaca, NY | Aug 2021 – Present*  
- Designed LongQAEval, a framework for the evaluation of long-from LLM outputs; when prompted with my framework LLM-as-judge agreement with experts increases by 24%, reaching expert-level agreement. 
- Identified unmet user needs in 15,000+ posts and 300,000+ comments from endometriosis online communities with fine-tuned DistilBERT models and few-shot learning.
- Leveraged causal inference to demonstrate that readers have no strong preference for character gender in a randomized survey experiment with 3,000 participants.

**Cornell University** — *Teaching Assistant, Data Science and Machine Learning*  
*Ithaca, NY | Jan 2024 – Dec 2024*  
- Taught weekly sections on data science, machine learning (ML), and natural language processing (NLP).
- Delivered lectures on social media analysis with NLP and statistical techniques for causal effect estimation.
- Curated a class activity on preprocessing large raw census data and applying ML to predict social outcomes.

**NYC Health + Hospitals** — *Data Science Intern*  
*New York City, NY | Jun 2023 – Aug 2023*  
*Funded by the Siegel Family Endowment PiTech PhD Impact Fellowship*  
- Identified three alerts frequently overridden by nurses by analyzing around 3,000,000 clinical interruptive alerts.
- Demonstrated that revising alert criteria can reduce unnecessary alerts by up to 94%, while improving alert design can decrease overridden alerts by up to 64%, through data analysis and statistical testing.
- Prompted hospital leadership to implement organization-wide routine alert revisions by presenting findings to administration and informatics experts.
